        More people are working from home than ever before, and job hunters are asking employers for the flexibility to choose their own workspace. But remote work means remote interviews. Here’s everything you need to know about virtual interviews
        and
        starting a new job online.

          <h2>How remote work has changed job hunting</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <br>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything for remote work. By April 2020, the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Office for National Statistics</a> recorded that 44% of workers in Scotland were doing at least part of their
            jobfrom home.</p>
          <p>But the pandemic only accelerated a change that was already happening. As technology has become smarter and faster, remote working is that bit easier for employees and employers. It offers more flexibility and lower costs across the
            board.
            In fact, the % of businesses across each country reporting a flexible workspace policy is impressive:</p>
          <p>With greater freedom and an improved work-life balance, it’s no surprise that almost 97.6% of people currently working remotely say they want to stay remote for at least part of their working hours, according to Vervoe. And 80% of
            company
            leaders plan to offer remote work as an option even after the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>But what happens if you don’t have a remote job yet? What is remote job hunting like? How do virtual interviews and onboarding work? And can you really be more productive working from home?
          </p>
          <p>Before we dive into finding your next remote role, let’s take a quick look at the pros and cons of working – and job hunting – from home.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Remote work and recruitment: the positives -->
      <div class="grid_container">

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Remote work and recruitment: the positives</h3>
          <p>During the pandemic, it’s estimated that almost 24 million people in the UK were working from home. According to <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/" target="_blank">Finder</a>, they saved over £1 billion a week between them in commuting
            costs and buying office lunches. There’s even tax relief available for people who work remotely.</p>
          <p>There are benefits for job seekers, too. You can fit the recruitment process around your own schedule and needs, which makes finding work easier for people with children or caring responsibilities. No wonder that <strong>86% of parents
              say
              they want to work flexibly</strong>, and “more time with family” is one of the top benefits of remote work according to Visual Capitalist.</p>
          <p>Remote interviews can be more accessible for people with disabilities – for example, by using subtitles on a video call if you have a hearing impairment, or enabling someone with mobility problems to join in from home. According to the
            Office for National Statistics, people with disabilities are 28% less likely to be employed – partly due to a lack of flexible recruitment options and accommodations at work. Virtual interviews and remote work open up new opportunities
            for
            people to find jobs that work for them.</p>
          <p>What’s more, you don’t have to spend time and money to travel to a remote interview. Remote recruitment even means that you can stay in a rural area, avoiding the high house prices in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. That means less
            expense and upheaval while you switch jobs, and more disposable income once you get started.</p>
          <p>But perhaps most importantly, remote interviews are less demanding for everyone involved. You’re at home, on your own turf, where you can feel comfortable and confident.</p>
          <p>“I really liked being in my own space,” said one young graduate we spoke to, who found her first job in 2020 after a remote interview. “I found it far less stressful and it meant I could just focus on the interview.”</p>

          <br />

          <h3 class="grid_padding">Remote work and recruitment: the positives</h3>
          <p>Before you commit to working from home, it’s important to think about whether it’s really the right fit for you. Remote work isn’t for everybody, and that’s fine. Ask yourself:</p>

          <br>

          <h3 class="grid_padding">Is remote work right for you?</h3>
          <p>Before you commit to working from home, it’s important to think about whether it’s really the right fit for you. Remote work isn’t for everybody, and that’s fine. Ask yourself:</p>

          <p>Even if you’re excited to work alone, you’ll still need to build up a support network. Loneliness can hit remote workers hard. In a survey by Small Biz Trends, 20% said that loneliness was the biggest downside to working from home. So
            you’ll need to be proactive about staying in touch with friends, colleagues, and other remote workers.</p>

          <h4>Do you feel confident working alone?</h4>
          <p>Especially if you’re early on in your career or starting an unfamiliar role, think carefully about whether you have all the skills you need. Remote support will be enough for some people, while others might prefer to learn in the office
            where there’s plenty of help to hand.</p>

          <h2>How to ace a virtual interview</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="stages">
          <p>When you think about a job interview, you probably picture the moment of the interview itself: sitting at a desk, answering questions, and trying to evaluate whether the job seems like a good fit for you.</p>
          <p>But there’s a bit more to it than that. If you want to excel at an interview – remote or in person – then there are three different stages to think about.</p>
          <p><a href="#stage1">STAGE 01:</a> Preparing for an interview</p>
          <p><a href="#stage2">STAGE 02:</a> During the interview</p>
          <p><a href="#stage3">STAGE 03:</a> Following up after the interview</p>
          <p>It’s important to do well in the interview. But your preparation and follow-up can also make all the difference. Someone who’s great at talking off-the-cuff can still perform badly if they haven’t done their research before an interview.
            Someone who struggles with confidence during an interview can improve their chances with a great follow-up message.</p>
          <p>So let’s go through those steps one by one, starting with how to prepare for a virtual interview.</p> 

          <br>

          <p class="stage" id="stage1">STAGE 01:</p>
          <h3>How to prepare for a remote interview</h3>
          <p>The first step is to think about what kind of interview you’re attending. With modern recruitment technology, there are lots of different ways to evaluate candidates.</p>
          <p>You’ll need to prepare differently depending on the type of virtual interview.</p>
          <p>For example, if you have a pre-recorded interview or a skills assessment coming up, then you’ll probably get some tips about which topics to prepare for. In a live interview, you’ll need to be ready to think on your feet. And if you’re
            asked to record a video CV, then you can practise a few times before you hit “record”.</p>
          <p>Next, think about when your interview is scheduled. Try to make sure that the virtual interview is set for a time when:</p>

          <div class="flex_item_chap_2">
            <p><strong>You’re in a quiet environment with no distractions.</strong></p>
            <p>For example, housemates have gone out to work or children are at school</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex_item_chap_2">
            <p><strong>You don’t have anything planned immediately before or after the interview.</strong></p>
            <p>So you don’t have to rush!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex_item_chap_2">
            <p><strong>You’ve had time to eat and drink.</strong></p>
            <p>Being hungry or thirsty can affect your performance – you don’t want to be distracted by a rumbling stomach!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex_item_chap_2">
            <p><strong>If possible, choose a time of day when you know your energy levels will be high.</strong></p>
            <p>For some people, this is first thing in the morning; others perk up in the afternoon.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="sticky_notes">
          <p>put sticky notes around the computer with any key points or questions you want to cover during the interview.</p>
          <div class="square_blue_overlay overlay_2"></div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Some remote jobs will involve time zone differences. If you’re interviewing with a company outside Scotland, make sure that you know which time zone they’re using. Ideally, the meeting time should work comfortably for both you and the
            interviewer.</p>
          <p>Now it’s time to do your research. This is what makes really good candidates stand out. Sure, you might have all the skills in the job description. But do you know what makes this job different? What are the company’s history, values,
            and top clients? What’s the latest topic on their blog? Do they have an email newsletter that you could read? And is there anything in the job description that you’d like to question, clarify, or discuss?</p>
          <p>If you know who is going to interview you, then you can research them too. Search for the names on a professional platform such as LinkedIn to find out more about their experience and interests. Maybe you have a past employer in
            common, or you both grew up in the same town. You don’t need to get too personal with this research, but a little background information could help you connect with your interviewers.</p>

          <br>

          <!-- stage 2 -->
          <p class="stage" id="stage2">STAGE 02:</p>
          <h3>During a remote interview</h3>

          <p>Even though the location and the set-up are different, a virtual interview is a lot like an in-person interview. You still need to show up on time, answer questions and make a good impression.<br />
          <p>But there are some extra tips for remote interviews, too. Because you’re speaking over an internet connection, it can be harder to hear clearly. Try to speak up and, if you’re a fast talker, maybe even slow down a little so that the
            interviewer has time to hear and process your answers. Avoid covering your mouth with your hand, which makes it harder to read your expression and hear your words.</p>
          <p>Just like in an in-person interview, good eye contact, posture, and a friendly smile can go a long way. You can create the impression of keeping eye contact by positioning your computer with the camera at eye level. Focus on the screen
            and try not to get distracted.</p>
          <p>A recent survey from VisualCV found that <strong>80% of unsuccessful candidates in a video interview seemed distracted</strong>. Keeping your gaze on the screen is a way to show interviewers that you are interested and engaged.</p>
          <p>According to recruiters, another big problem is candidates who seem to be reading from notes. It’s important to research and prepare, but avoid reading out answers or giving a speech that you’ve rehearsed. If you want to have notes, just
            write short reminders of key points rather than full sentences.</p>
          <p>Finally, you want to avoid any red flags in the interview. Recruiters say that they avoid candidates who:</p>

        <div class="virtual_interview_grid_item">

        <div class="stage_2">
          <p>As you can see, you don’t have to learn any fancy techniques or memorise a speech to ace your interview. If you’re on time, focused, polite, and interested, then you’ll get on well.</p>

          <h3>Following up after a remote interview</h3>

          <p>The interview’s over. You’ve answered all the questions, talked about your greatest strengths and weaknesses, and hopefully it’s gone well. Now what?</p>
          <p>If you want to make a really good impression on an employer, follow up after the interview. This is especially important if you’re job hunting remotely, because you’ve had fewer opportunities to connect with people in person. You missed
            out on the casual chat over coffee and the all-important handshake – but you can still make yourself memorable.</p>
          <p>If you discussed something in particular during the interview (for example, you told them about a project you worked on which seemed especially relevant), then you might send a link so they can follow it up.</p>

          <p>Sending a quick thank you note has several benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>It makes you more memorable to the interviewer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>It shows that you have strong communication skills.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>It opens the door to ask for feedback, even if your job application isn’t successful.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you don’t get the job this time, the interviewer might keep you in mind for a future role.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the interviewer didn’t say when they’d be in touch, this is also a chance to set expectations. Will you hear within the week? Will there be another round of interviews? If there are any questions that you forgot to ask during the
            interview, now’s your chance.</p>
