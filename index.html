        More people are working from home than ever before, and job hunters are asking employers for the flexibility to choose their own workspace. But remote work means remote interviews. Here’s everything you need to know about virtual interviews
        and
        starting a new job online.

          <h2>How remote work has changed job hunting</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <br>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed everything for remote work. By April 2020, the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Office for National Statistics</a> recorded that 44% of workers in Scotland were doing at least part of their
            jobfrom home.</p>
          <p>But the pandemic only accelerated a change that was already happening. As technology has become smarter and faster, remote working is that bit easier for employees and employers. It offers more flexibility and lower costs across the
            board.
            In fact, the % of businesses across each country reporting a flexible workspace policy is impressive:</p>
          <p>With greater freedom and an improved work-life balance, it’s no surprise that almost 97.6% of people currently working remotely say they want to stay remote for at least part of their working hours, according to Vervoe. And 80% of
            company
            leaders plan to offer remote work as an option even after the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>But what happens if you don’t have a remote job yet? What is remote job hunting like? How do virtual interviews and onboarding work? And can you really be more productive working from home?
          </p>
          <p>Before we dive into finding your next remote role, let’s take a quick look at the pros and cons of working – and job hunting – from home.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Remote work and recruitment: the positives</h3>
          <p>During the pandemic, it’s estimated that almost 24 million people in the UK were working from home. According to <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/" target="_blank">Finder</a>, they saved over £1 billion a week between them in commuting
            costs and buying office lunches. There’s even tax relief available for people who work remotely.</p>
          <p>There are benefits for job seekers, too. You can fit the recruitment process around your own schedule and needs, which makes finding work easier for people with children or caring responsibilities. No wonder that <strong>86% of parents
              say
              they want to work flexibly</strong>, and “more time with family” is one of the top benefits of remote work according to Visual Capitalist.</p>
          <p>Remote interviews can be more accessible for people with disabilities – for example, by using subtitles on a video call if you have a hearing impairment, or enabling someone with mobility problems to join in from home. According to the
            Office for National Statistics, people with disabilities are 28% less likely to be employed – partly due to a lack of flexible recruitment options and accommodations at work. Virtual interviews and remote work open up new opportunities
            for
            people to find jobs that work for them.</p>
          <p>What’s more, you don’t have to spend time and money to travel to a remote interview. Remote recruitment even means that you can stay in a rural area, avoiding the high house prices in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. That means less
            expense and upheaval while you switch jobs, and more disposable income once you get started.</p>
          <p>But perhaps most importantly, remote interviews are less demanding for everyone involved. You’re at home, on your own turf, where you can feel comfortable and confident.</p>
          <p>“I really liked being in my own space,” said one young graduate we spoke to, who found her first job in 2020 after a remote interview. “I found it far less stressful and it meant I could just focus on the interview.”</p>

          <br />

          <h3 class="grid_padding">Remote work and recruitment: the positives</h3>
          <p>Before you commit to working from home, it’s important to think about whether it’s really the right fit for you. Remote work isn’t for everybody, and that’s fine. Ask yourself:</p>

          <h2>How to ace a virtual interview</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <br>
          <p>When you think about a job interview, you probably picture the moment of the interview itself: sitting at a desk, answering questions, and trying to evaluate whether the job seems like a good fit for you.</p>
          <p>But there’s a bit more to it than that. If you want to excel at an interview – remote or in person – then there are three different stages to think about.</p>
          <p><span><strong>STAGE 01:</strong></span> Preparing for an interview</p>
          <p><span><strong>STAGE 02:</strong></span> During the interview</p>
          <p><span><strong>STAGE 03:</strong></span> Following up after the interview</p>
          <p>It’s important to do well in the interview. But your preparation and follow-up can also make all the difference. Someone who’s great at talking off-the-cuff can still perform badly if they haven’t done their research before an interview.
            Someone who struggles with confidence during an interview can improve their chances with a great follow-up message.</p>
          <p>So let’s go through those steps one by one, starting with how to prepare for a virtual interview.</p>
